# Blackjack

a very simple desktop blackjack game with GUI and TUI running in parallel.

This application is built using the Model View Controller architecture.

It uses:

* Google Guice for dependency injection.
* Apache log4j for output of errors and the TUI
* Maven for easy deployment and continuous integration with jenkins
* SonarQube for retriebing metrics

the configuration files for the stuff listed above are in this repository.
